          <p>Hey! Welcome to my digital home.</p>
          <p>Here you'll find a few pages about my interests,
            and some ramblings about things that I am working on,
            or have worked on in the past.</p>
          <p>
            I'll try to bridge the gap between some of my passions,
            including (but not limited to) software, music, and education.

        <p class="para" id="software">My professional career has largely been
          in software development, but I am also an avid music lover,
          who has been a part of many projects, usually as a drummer.

          Currently I work for Farm Direct, where I lead both the software and logistics deparments.
          We are a small team who are fighting for better food sustainability.
        </p>
        <p class="para" id="education">Teaching was probably my second choice
          as a major in university. Luckily, I have still found a way to work
          it in to my life along the way. Particularly, at a couple of awesome companies:
          Code Ninjas and School of Rock.
